## Guidelines
  
We welcome contributions from everyone and appreciate your consideration in helping us to improve our code, tests, and documentation.  All developers who want to contribute need to follow the following guidelines:

### Check milestones and issues
Before you start working, think about what you want to work on. Check out all existing milestones. Find milestones you want to work on or create new one. Like

Milestone #1
Title: Setting up the project
Due Date: none
Description: short summary 

After checking out the milestones you can click on them to find all the issues related to this milestone. You can also create a new issue for the milestone like this

Issue #1
Title: setting up the project structure
Description: short summary 
Assignees: [Assign yourself this issue]
Label: [Add at least one label]
Milestone: Setting up the project

### Create a branch with the issue 
After creating or choosing your issue, clone the main branch and create a new branch with the name of the issue. Start working and make the adjustments required to resolve that issue. 

### Making a commit
We follow the [conventional comits.](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)

Every commit should be linked to an issue and a milestone + at least one label. If the issue is a bug or a feature request it also has to be put into the related project.

Every commit you do link it to an issue with #?(Issue number) and a description how long the commit took you with a -?h(number of h) behind the # like #? -?h. When finished with an issue add all the commit hours together and put the total h into the issue header. An example would be 

feat: notifications add read button #13 - 3h

 if multiple people worked on it, edit the issue description by adding all the users who worked on the issue and their total commit hours to it. 

### After resolving an issue
We record all the issues and time taken in an invoice sheet for every developer. The invoice should have the issue's resolved with the time taken for each issue and a link to it on Github. 

You get paid every Monday for the issues you did within this week. Every developer has her/his own invoice sheet with all the issues they ever did + their payroll transaction links. if anyone wants to see the details what you did they just click on the issue links and see your commits and how long it took you.
